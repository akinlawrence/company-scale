# Project for a company -scale
## About this project
For a company, I created an software with a graphical user interface that illustrates the connection between weight, speed, and the scale. This software extracts real-time data directly from the scale while integrating flawlessly. The graphical user interface not only improves the user experience but also shows the variation in weight at different speeds in an understandable and visually appealing manner.

# The scale
The scale is a huge scale which is extremely accurete in measuring weight and that data is accessed straight from the serial port of the scale.

# Why two versions?
I experimented with two diferent approaches to make sure I got the results I desired. I ended up going with React since its extremely popular at moment.
